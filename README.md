# Anypoint Template: SAP to Salesforce Customer Broadcast

# License Agreement
This template is subject to the conditions of the 
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/templates-examples/AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf">MuleSoft License Agreement</a>.
Review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. You can use this template for free 
with the Mule Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio.

# Use Case
This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of customers from SAP to Salesforce.
Every time there is a new Customer (SFDC Account) or a change in an already existing one, SAP will send the IDoc with it to the running template which will update/create an account in the Salesforce target instance.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing). The batch job is divided in *Process* and *On Complete* stages.

The integration is triggered by an SAP Endpoint that receives a SAP Customer as IDoc XML. This XML is passed to the batch process.
In the *Process* stage the SAP Customer is transformed to a Salesforce Account and then upserted to Salesforce in the Batch Step using a Batch Aggregator.
Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.

# Considerations

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source (SAP) and destination (SFDC) systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. 
**Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Before continue with the use of this Anypoint Template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP), that will teach you how to work 
with SAP and Anypoint Studio.

## Disclaimer

This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies from Mulesoft in order to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support, you need to add three extra dependencies for SAP to the pom.xml file.


## SAP Considerations

Here's what you need to know to get this template to work with SAP.

### As a Data Source

The SAP backend system is used as a source of data. The SAP connector is used to send and receive the data from the SAP backend. 
The connector can either use RFC calls of BAPI functions and/or IDoc messages for data exchange, and needs to be properly customized per the "Properties to Configure" section.

The Partner profile needs to have a customized type of logical system set as partner type. An outbound parameter of message type DEBMAS should be defined in the partner profile. A RFC destination created earlier should be defined as Receiver Port. Idoc Type base type should be set as DEBMAS01.

## Salesforce Considerations

Here's what you need to know about Salesforce to get this template to work.

### FAQ

- Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=checking_field_accessibility_for_a_particular_field.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Checking Field Accessibility for a Particular Field</a>
- Can I modify the Field Access Settings? How? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=modifying_field_access_settings.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Modifying Field Access Settings</a>


### As a Data Destination

This template makes use of the `External ID` field offered by Salesforce. Here is a short description on how SFDC define external ID's 

+ [What is an external ID?](http://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=faq_import_general_what_is_an_external.htm)

The templates uses the External ID in order to do xRef between the entities in both systems. The idea is, once an entity is created in SFDC it's decorated with an ID from the source system which will be used afterwards for the template to reference it.

You will need to create a new custom field in your **Account** entity in SFDC with the following name: 

+ `sap_external_id`

### Importing a Template into Studio
In Studio, click the Exchange X icon in the upper left of the taskbar, log in with your
Anypoint Platform credentials, search for the template, and click **Open**.


### Running on Studio
After you import your template into Anypoint Studio, follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources.
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the "Properties to Configure" section.
+ Right click the template project folder.
+ Hover your mouse over `Run as`
+ Click `Mule Application (configure)`
+ Inside the dialog, select Environment and set the variable `mule.env` to the value `dev`

# API Calls
SalesForce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made.
Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to
consider. Customer Broadcast Template calls to the API can be
calculated using the formula:

**X / ${page.size}**

Being X the number of Customers to be synchronized on each run.

The division by ${page.size} is because, by default, Customers are gathered in groups
of ${page.size} for each Upsert API Call in the aggregation step. Also consider
that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 1 api
calls to SFDC will be made (1).


# Customize It!
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As Mule applications are based on XML files, this page describes the XML files used with this template.

More files are available such as test classes and Mule application files, but to keep it simple, we focus on these XML files:

* config.xml
* businessLogic.xml
* endpoints.xml
* errorHandling.xml


## config.xml
Configuration for connectors and configuration properties are set in this file. Even change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified are in properties file, which is the recommended place to make your changes. However if you want to do core changes to the logic, you need to modify this file.

In the Studio visual editor, the properties are on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml
Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by a batch job that will be responsible for creations/updates. The several message processors constitute three high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Anypoint Template:
1. The integration is triggered by a Document Source that receives a SAP Customer as IDoc XML. This XML is passed to the batch process.
2. In the *Process* stage the SAP Customer is transformed to a Salesforce Account and then upserted to Salesforce in the Batch Step using a Batch Aggregator.
3. Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.



## endpoints.xml
This file is formed by a flow containing the endpoints for triggering the template and for retrieving the objects that meet the defined criteria in the query. You can then execute the batch job process with the query results.



## errorHandling.xml
This is the right place to handle how your integration reacts depending on the different exceptions. 
This file provides error handling that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.
